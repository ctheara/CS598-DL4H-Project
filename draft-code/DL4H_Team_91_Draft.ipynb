        "  Longitudinal Electronic Health Records (EHRs) successfully used for clinical disease and outcome prediction using Deep Learning models.\n",
        "  State-of-the-art (SOTA) models outperform traditional ML models by using pretrain-finetune methods in EHR-based predictive modeling. However, their pre-training objectives are limited in predicting fraction of ICD codes within each visit. In real life scenarios, patients have multiple diseases which can be correlated and can contribute to disease progression and change in outcome.\n",
        "  Additionally, generalizing the same model on out-of-domain data in different medical settings with limited computing resources is a major challenge today.\n",

        "*   Paper explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "  The paper proposes TransformEHR, which is a generative encoder-decoder model with a transformer that is pre-trained using a new strategy, to predict the complete set of diseases and outcomes of patients at a future visit from previous visits. The model is generalizable and can be finetuned for various clinical prediction tasks with limited data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  TransformEHR uses encoder-decoder transformer architecture. The encoder processes the input embeddings and generates a set of hidden representations. The model performs cross-attention over hidden representations from the encoder and assigns an attention weight for each representation. The decoder generates ICD codes following the sequential order of code priority within a visit. It includes the date of each visit as a feature to integrate temporal information. The model uses 3 unique components compared to state-of-the-art models (BERT - Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) i.e. Visit masking, Encoder-decoder architecture and time embedding.\n",
        "\n",
        "  As per author, during the pretraining with a larger set of longitudinal EHR data, TransformEHR model learned the probability distribution of ICD codes through correlation of cross attention. Later It was fine-tuned to the predictions of a single disease or outcome.\n"

The result will be compared to the state-of-the-art model (BERT - Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) that is usually trained to predict a fraction of ICD codes within each visit. The model will use a transformer architecture and seek to outperform bidirectional encode-only models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hypothesis2: The other hypothesis could be that the TransformEHR model can perform better for single disease outcomes with pre-training than without pre-training. After carefully reviewing the large data requirement of the VHA dataset for pretraining, we realized that testing this hypothesis may not be feasible with limited computational resources.\n",

(The paper uses Transformers library and customized few classes for the implementation. During the DLH course assignments, we have not used this library therefore understanding the usage of transformers library and implementing the code parallelly is the biggest challenge we are facing currently.)\n",
